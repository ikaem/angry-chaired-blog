Angry Chaired Blog is a chronicle of my learning of web development. It is a collection of posts, usually belonging to a bigger project. While each project does have an idea and a set of overarching goals, posts are usually concerned with solving a specific problem.

## What can you find on Angry Chaired Blog?

At the moment there is not too much here: few partially-realized projects, use of questionable practices, and a bottomless pit of shady code. 
Still, there is also a lot of will and enthusiasm. I would like it to grow into a collection of projects related to web development. These would include frontend and backend development, video games for web, JS machine learning, use of various frameworks, development for mobile and so on. 
Every now and then, I would also like to include things no specifically related to web dev. Why not, right? 
So there. 

## Why am I writing it?

I am writing Angry Chaired blog to note what I learned about web development. I am writing it because it is fun. And I am writing it because I need a place to organize my enthusiasm. 
I realized it (my enthusiasm) is all over the place, and by putting planned, finished and pending ideas on the paper, I can focus it better. 

I also realized I learn things better by writing about them. It is a cliched realization, but I finally got it. Better late then never, right?

## Am I trying to teach you something?

To be clear, I am writing this for myself. I am not trying to teach you anything. I am a beginner myself, and I am trying to dip my toes in all of it. I can't possibl be considered an authority in any of this. 

But, if some of it helps you, in any way - hey, that's okay. 

## Who am I? 

Meh, who cares really...
